# odin-recipes

this is my first project for top! and in this project, i plan to include ordered lists, unordered lists, and hyperlinks. this will also be the first time to practice what i've learned about viable git commit messages. under this section, i will be documenting my reflections and realizations in learning while making the website

live site: https://kaf-ku.github.io/odin-recipes

reflections:
i should've done the recipe pages first then push, and attach them to the index after, then push again. it would've been more efficient and luckily i realized this before being halfway done through the project.

spent too long in commit messages, but i suppose that's good since im trying to make them better

learning shortcuts have been really helpful in changing content and navigating the vscode software
